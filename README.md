### Started off with user-service. Created a JwtUtil and JwtFilter for the user service...Also done with configuration class (defined 2 beans, one for SecurityFilterChain and the other for Bcrypt password encoder) .... Done with the AuthController.Secure-user-management-service almost completed, will integrate both the microservices using netflix-eureka-server(automatic service discovery using feign-clients...also cors enabled, using crossorigin)
