### Started off with user-service. Created a JwtUtil and JwtFilter for the user service...Also done with configuration class (defined 2 beans, one for SecurityFilterChain and the other for Bcrypt password encoder) .... Pending with the AuthController. After completion of secure-user-management-service , will integrate both the microservices using netflix-eureka-server(automatic service discovery using feign-clients...also cors enabled, using crossorigin)
